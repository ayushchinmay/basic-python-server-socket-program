		<b>Hello World, How are you doing?</b><br>
	The following example shows how to use the web-server for initiating a TCP connection. Services are normally differentiated by port numbers. When using the web-server to initiate the connection, port 80 is used for all services. Port 443 is used for all services if a secure connection is needed. Thus another mechanism is needed for differentiating the various services installed. When using a web-server for initiating a TCP connection, the services are differentiated by the URL to where the service is installed. The initial HTTP connection is only used for locating the service. As soon as the service starts, a pure TCP connection is established.
